# chat-translator

This is a simple [Minestom](https://minestom.net/) server implementation that allows players to chat in different languages and have
their messages automatically translated to the language of other players.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I don't plan to maintain this project so don't use this in production.

There are two main parts to this project:

- The Minestom server implementation in the `base` directory.
- The Spring Boot backend in the `api` directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Spring Boot backend is not done yet and is not connected to the Minestom server.
